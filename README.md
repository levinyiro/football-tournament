## user story
First of all, I initialize the data of tournament. I decide how much groups there will be, and how many person can be in the knockout (2, 4, 8, 16). There will be Team1, Team2, etc... and I can rename all of that. In every tournament I have to add players (so the name won't be unique in tournament table). This step will generate the matches. A match will have scores. At the end of the matches of a group the program will choose the for example two best player into a knock match. This step will generate the first knockmatches (group A first vs. group B second and group A second vs. group B first).

If a player win a knockout match, there will be generated a new knockout match with a round and a matchnumber.

Here's an example structure for a tournament with 4 knockout matches, including semifinals, finals, and a bronze match:

- Round 1: Semifinals
    - Match 1: Semifinal 1
    - Match 2: Semifinal 2
- Round 2: Bronze Match
    - Match 3: Bronze Match
- Round 3: Finals
    - Match 4: Final

A match is always generated automatically. If we delete a player from a group, or we repair or remove score in a match, then the next match will be modified or deleted.
